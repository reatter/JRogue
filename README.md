First game project with high goals: Switching between TurnBased and RealTime play during the game, comprehensive save game feature, and emergent gameplay of a Rougelike.

Trying to adhere to SOLID: Single Resoponsibility, Open-Closed Priciple, Liskov Substitution (way to go, IT, what a name), Interface Segregation (small Interfaces), and finally {Dependency Inversion}.
